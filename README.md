## 🚀 Projects

Here are a couple of projects I’ve been working on:

### Huellas Unidas
Huellas Unidas is a web and mobile platform designed to help locate lost pets and support stray animals. The application allows users to report and find missing animals efficiently, creating a supportive community that facilitates adoption and aids in animal welfare. This project focuses on accessibility and usability, using modern technologies such as **React**, **Next.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Stripe** to enable user interaction while ensuring data security.

### E-commerce
E-commerce is a basic online store that sells technology products such as computers, phones, smartwatches, and headphones from various brands. The project provides a simple shopping experience, featuring product browsing and filtering by category. While it does not have an integrated payment gateway, it allows users to view and manage products in a shopping cart. The store is built with technologies like **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Next.js**, and **PostgreSQL**, emphasizing responsive design and user experience.
